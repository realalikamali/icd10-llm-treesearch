**Clinical History:**

John Doe is a 67-year-old male with a history of mantle cell lymphoma, currently presenting with intrathoracic lymphadenopathy.

**Diagnosis:**

Peripheral blood smear and bone marrow, right posterior iliac crest, aspirate smears, touch preparation, clot and core biopsy:

1. Evidence of mantle cell lymphoma involving the bone marrow; see comment.
2. Hypercellular marrow for age (80% cellularity) with trilineage hematopoiesis and increased lymphoid infiltrate; see comment.
3. Peripheral blood with lymphocytosis.

**COMMENT:**

The bone marrow biopsy reveals a hypercellular marrow with an interstitial infiltrate of small to medium-sized lymphoid cells. Immunohistochemical stains demonstrate these cells are positive for CD20, CD5, and cyclin D1, consistent with mantle cell lymphoma. Flow cytometry confirms the presence of a monoclonal B-cell population co-expressing CD5 and CD23, with light chain restriction (kappa). There is no significant increase in blasts, and plasma cells are not increased by morphology. Clinical correlation is recommended.

**ANCILLARY STUDY PLAN:**

Flow cytometric immunophenotyping: Completed (see separate report for complete results)
Cytogenetics: Await
Additional Studies: Await FISH for t(11;14) translocation

**PERIPHERAL BLOOD:**

The findings are consistent with the results of the concurrent complete blood count. The red cells and platelets show no significant morphologic abnormalities. There is no overt increase in rouleaux formation. The white blood cells are composed predominantly of mature lymphocytes, with an increase in small to medium-sized lymphoid cells. No evidence of dysplasia is seen, and no circulating blasts or plasma cells are identified.

**ASPIRATE SMEAR:**

The aspirate material is adequate for evaluation. Cellular marrow particles are present showing maturing trilineage hematopoiesis. Granulocytic and erythroid precursors demonstrate a full spectrum of maturation and no significant dysplastic changes are identified. There is an increased presence of small to medium-sized lymphoid cells. Blasts are <5% of the total nucleated cell population. Megakaryocytes are present and have a normal range of morphology.

**Bone Marrow Aspirate Manual Differential (cell count = 200; normal adult range within parentheses):**

Blasts 1% (0-1), Promyelocytes 2% (1-3), Myelocytes 5% (2-10), Metamyelocytes 10% (5-15), Band forms 15% (10-40), Segmented neutrophils 20% (10-30), Monocytes 3% (0-3), Eosinophils 2% (0-3), Basophils 0% (0-1), Erythroids 25% (0-34), Lymphs 17% (5-15), Plasma cells 0% (0-3)

**TOUCH IMPRINT:**

Sparsely cellular material with mixed hematopoietic precursors consistent with the aspirate smear.

**CLOT SECTION:**

A few cellular particles are present showing maturing granulocytic and erythroid cells in keeping with the aspirate smears. No aggregates of blasts or plasma cells are identified. Increased lymphoid infiltrate is noted.

**BIOPSY:**

The bone marrow biopsy sections are adequate for evaluation. The bone marrow is hypercellular (approximately 80% cellularity). There is normal maturation in the granulocytic and erythroid lineages with a granulocytic:erythroid ratio of ~2-3:1. An interstitial infiltrate of small to medium-sized lymphoid cells is identified. Megakaryocytes are normal in number and have unremarkable morphology.

**CYTOGENETICS:**

Pending. Results will be reported as an addendum.

**IMMUNOPHENOTYPING:**

See separate UCSF flow cytometry report (IM16-#). Summary of pertinent findings: Monoclonal B-cell population co-expressing CD5 and CD23, with light chain restriction (kappa).

See separate University of Washington Medical Center, Seattle flow cytometry report for MRD (HP18- ). Summary of pertinent findings: Consistent with mantle cell lymphoma.

See separate Mayo Medical Laboratories flow cytometry report (Order# ) Summary of pertinent findings: Consistent with mantle cell lymphoma.

**IHC:**

Additional stains were performed and evaluated to further characterize the lymphoid population (CD20, CD5, cyclin D1). CD20 shows strong positivity. CD5 and cyclin D1 demonstrate co-expression consistent with mantle cell lymphoma.

Congo Red is negative for amyloid deposition under examination by polarized light; small vessels are present in the section.
