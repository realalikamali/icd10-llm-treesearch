**Clinical History:**

John Doe is a 67-year-old male with a history of follicular lymphoma, previously treated and currently under surveillance for potential recurrence.

**Diagnosis:**

Peripheral blood smear and bone marrow, right posterior iliac crest, aspirate smears, touch preparation, clot and core biopsy:

1. Morphologic and immunophenotypic evidence of follicular lymphoma, grade I, involving extranodal sites; see comment.
2. Hypercellular marrow for age (80% cellularity) with trilineage hematopoiesis, and no increase in blasts; see comment.
3. Peripheral blood with mild lymphocytosis.

**COMMENT:**

The bone marrow biopsy reveals a hypercellular marrow with involvement by follicular lymphoma, grade I. Immunohistochemical stains (CD20, CD10, BCL-2) confirm the presence of a neoplastic B-cell population with a follicular pattern. Flow cytometry on the concurrent sample identifies a monoclonal B-cell population expressing CD19, CD20, CD10, and BCL-2, consistent with follicular lymphoma. Blasts are <1% by morphology, and flow cytometry performed at UW, Seattle, was negative for an abnormal blast population.

Clinical correlation is recommended.

**ANCILLARY STUDY PLAN:**

Flow cytometric immunophenotyping: Completed (see separate report for complete results)
Cytogenetics: Await
Additional Studies: Await FISH for BCL-2 rearrangement

**PERIPHERAL BLOOD:**

The findings are consistent with the results of the concurrent complete blood count. The red cells and platelets show no significant morphologic abnormalities. There is no overt increase in rouleaux formation. The white blood cells are composed predominantly of mature lymphocytes, with a mild increase in atypical lymphocytes. No evidence of dysplasia is seen, and no circulating blasts are identified.

**ASPIRATE SMEAR:**

The aspirate material is adequate for evaluation. Cellular marrow particles are present showing maturing trilineage hematopoiesis. Granulocytic and erythroid precursors demonstrate a full spectrum of maturation and no significant dysplastic changes are identified. Plasma cells are not overtly increased, and no large aggregates are identified. Blasts are <1% of the total nucleated cell population. Megakaryocytes are present and have a normal range of morphology.

**Bone Marrow Aspirate Manual Differential (cell count = 200; normal adult range within parentheses):**

Blasts <1% (0-1), Promyelocytes 2% (1-3), Myelocytes 5% (2-10), Metamyelocytes 10% (5-15), Band forms 15% (10-40), Segmented neutrophils 20% (10-30), Monocytes 3% (0-3), Eosinophils 2% (0-3), Basophils 0% (0-1), Erythroids 25% (0-34), Lymphs 17% (5-15), Plasma cells 1% (0-3)

**TOUCH IMPRINT:**

Sparsely cellular material with mixed hematopoietic precursors consistent with the aspirate smear.

**CLOT SECTION:**

A few cellular particles are present showing maturing granulocytic and erythroid cells in keeping with the aspirate smears. No aggregates of blasts or plasma cells are identified.

**BIOPSY:**

The bone marrow biopsy sections are adequate for evaluation. The bone marrow is hypercellular (approximately 80% cellularity). There is normal maturation in the granulocytic and erythroid lineages with a granulocytic:erythroid ratio of ~2-3:1. No aggregates of blasts or plasma cells are identified. Megakaryocytes are normal in number and have unremarkable morphology.

**CYTOGENETICS:**

Pending. Results will be reported as an addendum.

**IMMUNOPHENOTYPING:**

See separate UCSF flow cytometry report (IM16-#). Summary of pertinent findings: Monoclonal B-cell population expressing CD19, CD20, CD10, and BCL-2.

See separate University of Washington Medical Center, Seattle flow cytometry report for MRD (HP18- ). Summary of pertinent findings: No evidence of minimal residual disease.

**IHC:**

Additional stains were performed and evaluated to further characterize the lymphoid population (CD20, CD10, BCL-2). CD20 shows diffuse positivity. CD10 and BCL-2 demonstrate a follicular pattern of staining.

Congo Red is negative for amyloid deposition under examination by polarized light; small vessels are present in the section.
