Clinical History:
Jane Smith is a 62 yo F with a history of lymphadenopathy and weight loss.

Diagnosis:

Peripheral blood smear and bone marrow, right posterior iliac crest, aspirate smears, touch preparation, clot and core biopsy:

1.	Mantle cell lymphoma involving the bone marrow; see comment.
2.	Cellular marrow for age (80% cellularity) with trilineage hematopoiesis, and an increase in lymphocytes; see comment.
3.	Peripheral blood with lymphocytosis.

COMMENT:


Clinical correlation is recommended.

The bone marrow biopsy sections show a diffuse and nodular infiltrate of small to medium-sized lymphocytes with irregular nuclear contours and a characteristic "clock face" chromatin pattern. Immunohistochemical stains (CD20, CD5, cyclin D1) confirm the diagnosis of mantle cell lymphoma. Flow cytometry on the concurrent sample was positive for an abnormal lymphocyte population expressing CD20, CD5, and lambda light chain restriction.

ANCILLARY STUDY PLAN:
Flow cytometric immunophenotyping:  Completed (see separate report for complete results)
Cytogenetics: t(11;14)(q13;q32) translocation detected
Additional Studies: FISH for CCND1/IGH fusion is positive

PERIPHERAL BLOOD:  The findings are consistent with the results of the concurrent complete blood count. The white blood cells are composed predominantly of mature lymphocytes, with a significant increase in lymphocytes (60% of total WBC). No evidence of dysplasia is seen, and no circulating blasts or plasma cells are identified.

ASPIRATE SMEAR:  The aspirate material is adequate for evaluation. Cellular marrow particles are present showing maturing trilineage hematopoiesis and an increase in lymphocytes. Lymphocytes are small to medium-sized with irregular nuclear contours.

Bone Marrow Aspirate Manual Differential (cell count = 200; normal adult range within parentheses):
Lymphs 60% (5-15), Blasts 0% (0-1), Promyelocytes 1% (1-3), Myelocytes 2% (2-10), Metamyelocytes 3% (5-15), Band forms 5% (10-40), Segmented neutrophils 10% (10-30), Monocytes 2% (0-3), Eosinophils 1% (0-3), Basophils 0% (0-1), Erythroids 10% (0-34), Plasma cells 1% (0-3)

TOUCH IMPRINT:  Cellular material with a predominance of lymphocytes consistent with the aspirate smear.

CLOT SECTION:  A few cellular particles are present showing a mixture of lymphocytes and maturing granulocytic and erythroid cells.

BIOPSY:  The bone marrow biopsy sections are adequate for evaluation.  The bone marrow is cellular (approximately 80% cellularity). There is a diffuse and nodular infiltrate of lymphocytes with a characteristic "clock face" chromatin pattern.

CYTOGENETICS: 
t(11;14)(q13;q32) translocation detected.

IMMUNOPHENOTYPING:  
See separate flow cytometry report.  Summary of pertinent findings:
Abnormal lymphocyte population expressing CD20, CD5, and lambda light chain restriction.

IHC
Additional stains were performed and evaluated to further characterize the lymphocyte population (CD20, CD5, cyclin D1).  CD20 and CD5 show strong positivity in the lymphocytes. Cyclin D1 is positive in the lymphocytes, confirming the diagnosis of mantle cell lymphoma.
